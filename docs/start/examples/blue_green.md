# Blue Green Deployments

This is effectively the same configuration as our [Dynamic Upstreams]({{ site.baseurl }}/start/examples/dynamic) example.
The only difference is that api-blue.example.com and api-green.example.com have the same service deployed to them.  Shield
will load balance requests across the two upstreams according to their weight.

Editing the weight in `shield_upstreams.conf` will prompt Shield to smoothly transition their weight from its current
value to its new target value (NB: The weights do not need to sum to 100).
